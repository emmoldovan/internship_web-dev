## 1. What I've learned:

a) `Today I've continued with the course:` **HTML & CSS for Beginners | FREE MEGA COURSE (7+ Hours!)**

(from 1:36 to )

Forms and Buttons:

```html
    <form action="Here we specify where the information will be sent, usually to a file" method="Represents how to form information will be sent"></form>

    * Two options for the method: get or post (post is more secure)

    <form action="" method="">
        <div>
            <label for="login-email">Email address</label>
            <input type="email" name="the-login-email" id="login-email">
        </div>
    </form>

```


b) `I've continued with building the page:` https://www.spotify.com/ro-ro/download/windows/

* While building the page I've practiced what I've learned so far and also I've learned some new things
