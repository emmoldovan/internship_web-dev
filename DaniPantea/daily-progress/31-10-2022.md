### a) `Start of React course:` - [The Creative React and Redux Course](https://developedbyed.com/courses/1203573/lectures/26842773)
Progress: Chapter 2 - Video 4


    -  Learning about Props and State concepts


Personal Notes:

useState --> used for automatically render the UI on change events


`//syntax for import React and useState`<br/>
import React, { useState } from 'react';

`//declaring variables for useState`<br/>
const [name, setName] = useState('Looney Tunes')

`//setting new value to useState`<br/>
setName('Florin')  <- this is the new name


A note about using arrow function:

- use arrow function when invoking a function with arguments to prevent it running by itself

`for example:`<br/>
onClick={() => setTextInput('')} 

<br/>

`A detailed example:`<br/>
```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const CreateTweet = () => {

// setting the state to empty string
const [textInput, setTextInput] = useState('');

const userInputHandler = (e) => {
//changing the state using setTextInput to have the value from our target event
	setTextInput(e.target.value);
}
	return (
	<div>

//using onChange event for our textarea and passing the handler userInputHandler
//by setting the value of textarea as {textInput} we are connecting the state to it

	<textarea
		onChange={userInputHandler} 
		value={textInput} 
		cols="30" 
		rows="5">
	</textarea>

	</div>
	)
}
```



some notes:

If your state updates, you want your app to be like your state is (because your state literally react to your UI), so these things should be connected together (because if you don't you will have some weird behavior of seeing data on your screen or on your UI but your state looks different)

basically: the way your state is (the data that you have in your state) is gone reflect how your application looks like
so, by just looking your state and the data you have in state you can already imagine how your website looks like
