## 1. What are HTML and CSS
	
The building blocks of the web
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
	
## HTML

<p> HTML is a markup language, it tells the browser what the content we are writing actually is (for example):<p>

* Heading
* Regular paragraph
* A link
* Bold or italic text
* A navigation
* Footer
* The main content of the page

## Basic syntax of HTML
\- Using Tags <-- the browser identifies the content wrapped in tags and know what is what

\<tag> Opening tag

\</tag> Closing tag

An opening and a closing tags forms together an Element

## Recap:
	- Tags are inside of <> 
	- Closing tags include a forward slash </>
	- Everything from the opening to closing tag is called an Element
	- Elements define our content to the browser 


## Basic file structure

\<!DOCTYPE html> --> Tells the browser that this is a HTML5 document

\<html> --> Tells the browser that we are starting to write HTML - Acts as a "root" of out document

\<head> Metainformation
* Is not visible to the visitor
* It contains essential information
* It's more like a "brain" than a "head"

\<title> 
* It is part of the <head> </head> element
* Not visible in the actual page, but can be seen when hovering over page's tab in the browser, and shows up in the search results

\<body>
* Contains the content that will be visible to the user when visiting the website

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My first website</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        
    </body>
</html>
```

## Heading and paragraphs

\- Headings - denote hierarchy and page structure
    
* Six levels of headings: \<h1>,\<h2>,\<h3>,\<h4>,\<h5>,\<h6>

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My first website</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>My very first webpage</h1>
        <h2>Learning headings: this is heading h2</h2>
        <h3>Heading 3</h3>
        <h4>Heading 4</h4>
        <h5>Heading 5</h5>
        <h6>Heading 6</h6>
    </body>
</html>
```

\- Paragraphs are the regular text
* \<p>

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My first website</title>
    </head>
    
    <body>
        <h1>My very first webpage</h1>
        <h2>Websites are built with HTML</h2>
        <p>HTML is a markup language that tells the browser what everything is</p>
        <p>Awesome</p>
    </body> 
</html>
```

## Recap:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title> write page title here </title>
	</head>
	<body>
	
	Content goes here
	
	</body>
</html>
```

* Remember to always close a heading or paragraph before starting another one
* \<h1> to \<h6> only, there is no \<h7> and beyond
* \<p> only, there is no \<p1>, \<p2>, etc.

## Strong and emphasis

\<strong>
* Text inside this tag indicates that it is of strong importance
* Browsers makes this text bold

\<em>
* The text inside this tag has stress emphasis
* Browsers makes this text italic

This tags are inline elements, are used inside paragraphs
