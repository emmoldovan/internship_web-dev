## 1. What are HTML and CSS
	
`The building blocks of the web`
> * HTML
> * CSS
> * JavaScript
	
## HTML

`HTML is a markup language, it tells the browser what the content we are writing actually is (for example):`

> * Heading
> * Regular paragraph
> * A link
> * Bold or italic text
> * A navigation
> * Footer
> * The main content of the page

## Basic syntax of HTML
`- Using Tags <-- the browser identifies the content wrapped in tags and know what is what`

> \<tag> Opening tag

> \</tag> Closing tag

An opening and a closing tags forms together an Element

## Recap:
	- Tags are inside of <> 
	- Closing tags include a forward slash </>
	- Everything from the opening to closing tag is called an Element
	- Elements define our content to the browser 


## Basic file structure

> \<!DOCTYPE html>

Tells the browser that this is a HTML5 document

> \<html> 

Tells the browser that we are starting to write HTML - Acts as a "root" of out document

> \<head> Metainformation
* Is not visible to the visitor
* It contains essential information
* It's more like a "brain" than a "head"

> \<title> 
* It is part of the <head> </head> element
* Not visible in the actual page, but can be seen when hovering over page's tab in the browser, and shows up in the search results

> \<body>
* Contains the content that will be visible to the user when visiting the website

### Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My first website</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        
    </body>
</html>
```

## Heading and paragraphs

`- Headings - denote hierarchy and page structure`
    
* Six levels of headings: 
> \<h1>,\<h2>,\<h3>,\<h4>,\<h5>,\<h6>

### Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My first website</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>My very first webpage</h1>
        <h2>Learning headings: this is heading h2</h2>
        <h3>Heading 3</h3>
        <h4>Heading 4</h4>
        <h5>Heading 5</h5>
        <h6>Heading 6</h6>
    </body>
</html>
```

`- Paragraphs are the regular text`
> * \<p>

### Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My first website</title>
    </head>
    
    <body>
        <h1>My very first webpage</h1>
        <h2>Websites are built with HTML</h2>
        <p>HTML is a markup language that tells the browser what everything is</p>
        <p>Awesome</p>
    </body> 
</html>
```

## Recap:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title> write page title here </title>
	</head>
	<body>
	
	Content goes here
	
	</body>
</html>
```

* Remember to always close a heading or paragraph before starting another one
* \<h1> to \<h6> only, there is no \<h7> and beyond
* \<p> only, there is no \<p1>, \<p2>, etc.

## Strong and emphasis

> \<strong>
* Text inside this tag indicates that it is of strong importance
* Browsers makes this text **bold**

> \<em>
* The text inside this tag has stress emphasis
* Browsers makes this text *italics*

This tags are inline elements, are used inside paragraphs

\<strong> and \<em> needs to be closed before a new paragraph

### Exercise:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>This is my first website</title>
    </head>
<body>
    <h1>This is my first website</h1>
    <p>I'm learning HTML from scratch</p>
    <h2>I'm looking forward for exciting times</h2>
    <p><strong>Today</strong><em> I'm writing</em> first line of code</p> 
</body>
</html>
```


## File naming and organization

### File naming unwritten rules
* Keep file name short
* Use descriptive names

    (e.g. bad: "page1.html" vs good: "index.html")
* No spaces, use underscores or hyphens instead
* Use lower case ("About-Us.html" vs "about-us.html")

### File organization

* The main folder is called **root folder**
* The homepage **must be** `index.html`
* `index.html` **must be in the root folder**, and not a subfolder
* Other pages could be in subfolders
* Images should be placed in a subfolder
