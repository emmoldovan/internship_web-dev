# 1. What I've learned/practiced:

<br>

### a) `Working on the user-card exercise`

    - adding a new user card when we press Add button from the form with the user inputs - DONE
    - removing user card when pressing delete button within the user-card: 
          -> Here I still need to make some adjustments because the card is not deleted correctly, therefore when I add a new card it will result in adding back the cards deleted before. 
    - edit a user card when pressing edit button within user-card: DONE

    - next-step: 
        -> to repair: not working properly when I want to add a new user. New card is not added -> error received related to id
