## 1. What I've learned:

`Today I've continued with the course:` **Learn and apply HTML/CSS basics**

### HTML Anchor and Attributes

* I've learned how to create a link with HTML using \<a> tag
* Attributes can be added to an opening tag to give extra information to the browser

### Example:
> \<a href="http://google.com">Google\</a>

* I've learned what is the difference between absolute and relative path for links in HTML
    * For absolute path the full address must be included using http:// or https:// 
    > \<a href=\"http://duckduckgo.com\">Duckduckgo\</a>
    * Relative path can be used when you link pages from the same website
    > \<a href="about-us.html">About Us\</a>

## CSS Introduction and Basics

* CSS is short for **Cascading Style Sheets**
* For CSS we use *property:value* in pairs
* We are using colon **":"** for separation of the property and the value
* We are using semicolon **";"** for ending the property-value attribute

## Practice
 *this is the section from tutorial where I had to practice what I've learned so far regarding HTML and applying CSS

`Some of the properties used until now:`

> style="background-color: red;"

> style="color: blue;"

> style="font-size: 30px;"

> style="text-align: left / center / right;"

`The pages created for practice:`

index.html
```html
<!-- 
HTML
  - h1 (the title of the page)
  - An introductory paragraph
  - Two h2s, each followed by a few paragraphs
  - Inside the paragraphs, use strong and emphasis tags
  - If you are feeling adventorus add a second page and link to it
  
CSS
  - Change the color of the h1
  - Change the text alignment of the h1
  - Change the color of the h2s
  - Change the font-size of the paragraphs
  - If you added a link, change the color of it
 -->
