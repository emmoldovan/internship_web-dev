c) `Others:` 

* I've posted my first article on Linkedin


## 2. Questions I have:

How should I proceed when I first start to create a website page?

I know I have to add all the content with the help of HTML, and this I would say is the easy part but still I need to structure the code in a good way. After that I will need to apply the styles with CSS. Here I will have to create a lot of classes, therefore which are the good practice rules to follow so that I can organize myself better?

I feel that when a lot of content is inside the page I will loose track and I don't really know what classes to create and for which elements...there is a degree of confusion here
