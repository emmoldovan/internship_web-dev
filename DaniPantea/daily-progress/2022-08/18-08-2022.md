## 1. What I've learned:

`Today I've continued with the course:` **Learn and apply HTML/CSS basics**

> Lesson 16 to Lesson 27


1. I've learned about Internal and External CSS and how to apply it in the HTML 

* For Internal CSS we are applying the style to an element using Selectors, in the "head" section of the page 
    
    ```html
    <head>
    <style>
        h1 {
            font-size: 25px;
            color: red;
        }
    </style>
    </head>
    ```

* For External CSS we are creating a different forlder named "css" where we add a "style.css" file. Within this file we are defining out style for each element. After that with the "link" tag added to each page on "head" section we create the relationship between pages and the "style.css" file

    ```html 
        <head>
        <link href="css/style.css" rel="stylesheet">
        </head>
    ```

2. I've learned about Classes and IDs and how to use them when appling CSS

`ID can be used only once, Class can be used multiple times`

* In "style.css" file we define a class and an ID like below:

```html
<!-- this is a Class -->
.page-title {
    font-size: 30px;
    color: blue;
}

<!-- this is an ID -->
#header {
    color: darkred;
}
```
* In the HTML page we call a Class or an ID like below:

```html
<!-- Class -->
<h1 class="page-title">This is the title of the webpage</h1>

<!-- ID -->
<h2 id="header">This is the H2</h2>
```

3. I've learned about Comments and how to add them in HTML and CSS and why is important to add comments

```html
<!-- Between these symbols we can add comments in HTML -->
```

```css
/* Between these symbols we can add comments in CSS */
```

4. I've learned about Margin, Padding and Borders

* Margins are used to control the position of an element

* Padding is used to add more background, to control the positioning of the content inside the element

5. I went through the introductory of the flexbox and how to create columns with display:flex attribute

    `When we apply display:flex attribute to an element all the children of that element will become columns`

## 2. Questions I have:
`none`
