# Daily progress 08-08-2022

## This is my first *daily report*

Today I've started the first Internship task: **Git & GitHub** training

I've watched the Tutorial *Learn Git In 15 Minutes* from [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE) 

---

## What I've learned:

### 1. What is Git?

* Distributed Version Control System (VCS)
* A system that tracks changes to project files over time
* Gives the ability to record project changes and go back to a specific version
* The system can be used by many people 
* Provides the way to efficiently work together (to collaborate on team projects)
* Each developer can have their own version of the project distributed on their computer
* The individual versions can be merged and adapted into the main version of the project

### 2. How to install Git on my PC

### 3. Git Commands: 

* Checking with Terminal from Visual Studio Code, Power shell and command prompt the installed version of Git with command: 
    * **git** --version

* I've configured my name and email using the below commands:
    * **git** *config* --global user.name "Daniel Pantea"
    * **git** *config* --global user.email "d########a@gmail.com"

### 4. What is a repository
* A container for a project that is tracked by Git

Two types of Git repositories:

1. Local repository
    * it is stored on your computer;
    * you work on the local version of the project;
		
1. Remote repository
    * stored usually on a remote server; 
    * useful for working in teams; 
    * the place to share you project code;
	* see other people's code & integrate it into your local version
	* you can push your changes to the remote repository
