Today I've finished the Tutorial *Learn Git In 15 Minutes*

---

## What I've learned:

### 1. How to Initialize a repository

The repository can be created on a specific folder where you want to save the project.
The command to be used for creating a new repository is:

* **git** *init* <-- This will create a hidden .git directory for your project;

### 2. Checking the status

* **git** *status* <-- The command shows which files have been changed, which files are tracked, etc.;

### 3. Staging files
* **git** *add* file1.js <-- add specific file;
* **git** *add* file2.js file3.js file4.js <-- add multiple files;
* **git** *add* . <-- add all the files inside the project folder to the staging area;

After the files are added to the staging area, they are ready to be committed and tracked.

### 4. Making commits

A commit is a snapshot of the code at a particular time, which we are saving to the commit history of our repository.

* **git** *commit* -m "Here we can write a commit message that will help us know what was changed"

### 5. Going back to a previous state

*  **git** *checkout* \<commit-hash> <-- instead of \<commit-hash> the actual hash of a specific commit needs to be added here;
*  **git** *checkout* master <-- go back to the latest commit (newest version of project code) / (or change back to the master if you were on another branch);

### 6. Ignoring files

* **.gitignore** <-- you can create a file called .gitignore in main project folder to ignore files that you don't want to be tracked or added to the staging area; (I need to learn more about this)

### 7. Branches

*  Branches are individual timelines of our project commits;
*  Many alternative environments can be created, other versions of the project code can exist and be tracked in parallel;

#### 7.1 Creating a new branch

* **git** *branch* \<new-branch-name> <-- the new branch created will be the reference of the current state of the repository;

#### 7.2 Changing branches

* **git** *checkout* \<branch-name> <-- switch to a different branch; switch to a different timeline of your project;
*  **git** *checkout* -b \<new-branch-name> <-- create and change to a new branch at the same;
*  **git** *checkout* master <-- go back to master branch;

#### 7.3 Merging branches

* **git** *merge* \<branch-name> <-- merge the changes from a different branch into your current branch;

#### 7.4 Deleting a branch

* **git** *branch* -d \<branch-name>

### 8. Other commands:

* **touch** ExampleFile.txt <-- this will create a file in directory folder;
* **git** *log* <-- gives a history of commits;
* **clear** <-- clears the terminal screen;
