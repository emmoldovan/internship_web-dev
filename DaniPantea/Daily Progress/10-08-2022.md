## What I've learned

### 1. What is Markdown?

```	
	- Lightweight markup language with a plain text formatting syntax
	- Can be converted into HTML/XHTML and other formats
	- It's main purpose: readability and ease of use
```

### 2. What is Markdown used for?

```
	- Readme Files (Github, etc.)
	- Forum & Blog Posts

```


The files extension for Markdown files is .md

### 3. Basic types of formatting that can be done with core Markdown

```
	- Headings
	- Lists
	- Emphasis (e.g. bold, italics)
	- Links
	- Blocks of Code
	- Images
	- Blockquotes
	- Horizontal Rules
```

### 4. Markdown Editors

```
	- Text Editor Extensions (VSCode [extension Auto Open Markdown Previewer], Atom, etc.)
	- MarkPad
	- HarooPad
	- MarkdownPad 2
    - Typora
```

## How the special characters are used to format text:

Below are some examples:

### 1. Using tag or multiple tags to format Headings:

For example:
# \# Heading 1
## \## Heading 2
### \### Heading 3

### 2. Using asterisks to format text as italics or strong:

This is an *\*italic\** text

This is a **\*\*strong\*\*** text

### 3. How to strikethrough a text

Use the following special characters \~\~ to strikethrough a text like this: \~\~sample text\~\~

### 4. How to add horizontal rule

Use the following: --- or ___ (3 dashes or underscores)

---

### 5. How to escape a special character
