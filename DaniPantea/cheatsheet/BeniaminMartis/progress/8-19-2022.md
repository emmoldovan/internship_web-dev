<h1>Today I have practiced <strong>HTML</strong>. I became more familiar with writting it, I have created my own site. I Organized it too look good. </h1>


- `<!DOCTYPE html>` 
(you write this once it goes at the top of the document telling the server that it is a html document)

- `<head>` CONTENT `</head>` (happens towards the top of the html page and this is the behind the scenes meta for the browser. This is where you set a title for the page, initial scripts etc..)
<br><br>
- HTML TAGS <br>
`<head>` (happens at the top of the html document) <br>
`<body>` (within the body tag you can have loads of other tags) <br>
`<p>` (some common tags inside the `<body>` tag are) (paragraph tag) <br>
`<a>` (ancor tag, the one we use to create hiper links<br>
`<h1>`  `</h1>`  (header tags) <br>
`<div>` (division tag, how you will devide a portion of the page)<br>
`<table>` (when you organize a large table) not as common<br>

- Also, I have learned that before you define the content that they will click on you need to define the hipper link reference. <br>
`<a href=”path..”>Click Here</a>`<br>
href= (actual reference to the image) 

-  Inserting HTML Comments
`<!-- -->` (this is how you leave an html comment. The note goes between the lines, the comment will not show on the site it will only show in the notepad, so it is easier to erganise your html site. Always leave comments as reference for yourself  )

- `CSS - Adding Style to a Paragraph`<br>
You can get into styles into each tag. <br>
`<p style="text-align:center">` <br>(if you write this in the `<p>`tag it will align the whole paragraph in the center. <br>
```
<ol>
`1.	<p style=`"text-align:center"> <br>
`2.	<p style="text-align:justify">` (it will rearrange the paragraph so it looks neat)<br>
`3.	<p style="text-align:right">`<br>
`4.	<p style="text-align:left">`<br>
</ol>
```
