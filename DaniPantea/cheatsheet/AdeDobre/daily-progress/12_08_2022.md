# Week 8-12ofAugust2022

## This week was very productive.



I have finished the __HTML&CSS training__ and I have learned the following: 
* Difference between HTML and CSS;
* Difference between margin and padding;
* I was able to add an paragraph; to bold or italic the text; to add a link or to add an image;
* I was using the basic syntax in order to create and desing a text 
* Box model;
* Borders; 
* Playing with the colors, font and text-align;
* Classes and ID's.

## HTML, CSS and JavaScript  

> HTML - HyperText Markup Language 


> CSS - Cascading Style Sheets 
CSS - is all about the design of a website; Here we can talk about: colors, font, backgrounds, layout;

> JavaScript - is a programming language 
It can be used to create full web applications.

 
## HTML 
Is the content of websites and it tells the browser what the content we are writting acctually is: 

* could be headings, paragraphs
* links
* italic or bold text 
* footer 
* a navigation     

### _Basic syntax of HTML_ 

Tags are insite of angular brackets < >

An __"element"__ means an opening and a closing tag 

> \<tag>   Opening tag 

> \</tag> Closing tag 

### _HTML&CSS Crash Course_ - _Basic file structure_

> <! Doctype html> - tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document 
> \<head> 
* is not visible for visitor
* has a metatags
* control everything behind the scene 

> \<title> 
* is located inside of the document 
* not visible in the page, but shows up in the browser (Eg: scrimba.com)

Example: 

\<!DOCTYPE html>

\<html>

\<head>My first website 
\</head>
\<body>
\<h1>My very first page \</h1>

\<h2>How to create a page using HTML \</h2>
\</body>

\</html>

> \<body>
is visible when you visit a page 

> headings and paragraphs 

Headings:  \<h1> - \<h6>

Paragraphs: \<p> - they are not numbered 

> \<strong> indicates that the text is <strong> importance </strong>

> \<em> - emphasis - make the text italic: What a <em>wonderful</em> day

! Don't <strong>forget</strong> to close tags 
\<strong> \</strong> or 
\<em> \</em>

> HTML anchors and attributes
* we use "a" tag to make a link 

* Elements can have attributes and attributes are followed by an equal sign and quotation marks: 

\<a href="http://google.com">google \</a>


* A link will works only with an _href_ attribute

## CSS - It is all about style 

> properties - what we want to change (color, font-size, font-weight);

> values - what we want to set that property to (font-size);

> the syntax - there must be a colon between the property and value (fon-size: 21px; ) and a semicolon after the value.  

> the style attribute - we cand wirte CSS inside the quotation marks \<p style="font-size: 21 px">

## HTML Lists 

> ol - order list 

\<ol>

\<li>\</li>

\</ol>

> ul - unorder list 

\<ul>

\<li>
\</li>

\</ul>

## Images - use the src (source) attribute 
### Internal CSS 


\<img src="image.jpg">

> Selectors - what we are selecting 

\body {
    color: #323232;
}

> Declaration - the property: Value pair 

\body {
   color: #323232; 
}

>Rule - made up of a selector and property: value declarations 

>Selecting an element
* write the element but without the brackets; \a {...}
* don't include attributes; \p{...} ; \h2{...}


### External CSS 
We can have one stylesheet controlling all of our pages at the same time 

>Classes and ID's 

Classes are a type of attribute we can add to an HTML element 

\<p class="intro">...</p> 

In CSS the class attribute is referenced by using a full stop: 

.intro {
    fontsize: 18px; 
    color: #2b5dad; 
}

The ID selector - ID's are a type of attribute we can add to an HTML element 

\<p id="intro">.../</p>

An ID is represented by a hastag 

#intro {
    font-size: 18 px; 
    color: #2b5dad; 
}

>ID vs Class 

ID - is an individual and can only be used on time per page 

Class - is a group and can be used over and over again 

>Comments 

In HTML <!-- comment -->

In CSS /* comment */ 

Short command for Windows : ctrl + / 

>Tags 

* _header_
* _main_
* _section_
* _footer_
* _nav_
* _div_


>Margins and padding 

Margins are used to control the position of an element relative to those around it 
* margin-left
* margin-right
* margin-top
* margin-bottom

_Shorthand Margin_ e.g.:  (10px - top; 20px right; 30px-bottom; 40px:left)

>Padding is used to control the positioning of the content _inside_ our element 

It works just like margin in terms of the long form and shorhand properties 

Recap: __Marginin__ adds empty space to the outside; __Padding__ adds empty space to the inside 

Margin=empty space 

Padding = more background 

>Borders - it takes three properties to set a border: 
* border-width
* border-style
* border-color 

>The box model 

The four parts of an element: 
* the content itself 
* the padding 
* the border 
* the margin 

The margin, padding and borders add width to the left and the right 

>__Exercises time__ - here I put in practice all I have learned from the course (adding headings, paragraps, background color, align the text, adding image, desing the text, using paddings and margins, color the text) 

>Columns - when setting display: flex on a element, all the children will become columns
