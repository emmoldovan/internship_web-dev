# Progress Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday

### During these days, I have managed to learn the following things:

1. HTML & CSS crash course finished: 
* Borders
* Classes & IDs
* Box Model
* Margin vs. padding
* Some nice _layouts_ created from scratch

2. Regarding the first website project:
* Started working on the first Spotify page
* Managed to __cover the 2 sections of the main__, with the _device options_ and _download options_ from google/apple/microsoft store

There were some questions during the first phase of the project, but most of them had been answered. There will still be some issues, I think, when overlapping and arranging images on top of each other. 

* What I have to focus on, is to write cleaner code, in order to make it widely accesible.
