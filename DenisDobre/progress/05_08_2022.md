1. Today was fun, since I got to learn HTML & CSS basics. I was suprised to discover the fact that I was pretty fast in learning them. I have reached chapter 13 so far. 

Mainly, I very well understood the following aspects: 
* You're the CSS to my HTML principle;
* The syntax is clearly known so far, both HTML & CSS;
* Strong vs. emphasis;
* Anchors vs. Attributes;

1. I got to design my first decent looking site, using HTML & CSS - i used different colors, background colors, played with the font size a little bit and also, quite important, I am now able to make links in between different HTML files.

1. No questions. Works fine so far.
