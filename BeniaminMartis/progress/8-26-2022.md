- `Borders` add a border around your element. 

_It takes three properties to set a border_
<ul>

- border-width
- border-style
- border-color
</ul>

- Shorthand border: [width] [style] [color] - they can be placed in any order
<ul>

_You can also control specific sides_

- `border-left` - shorthand for only the left border
- `border-right-width` only modifying the width of the right border
</ul>

border-style

* you can also use border shorthand (the order you put them in doesn't matter
* border: 2px solid pink;
* you can also control the border of the different sides independently 
```
border-left: 2px solid pink;
border-right: 5px dotted red;
border-bottom: 10px double green;
border-top: 1px dashed purple;
```
