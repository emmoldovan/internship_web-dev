- I have learned today that, the way to leave a coment in CSS is: `/* COMMENT HERE */`
/* If you hold CTRL and press the forward slash it will automatically set up the note taking that will not show up in the browser. THis is done in HTML and CSS */

- CTRL scroll on the mouse will enlarge an image. 
- I have practiced CSS and HTML, tryiing to familiarize miself more with the HTML and CSS programing codes and language.
