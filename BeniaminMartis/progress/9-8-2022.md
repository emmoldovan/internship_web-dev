Today I have learned that: If your definition contains repeating parts, you can use the repeat`()` notation to streamline things:

- The `fr` unit allows you to set the size of a track as a fraction of the free space of the grid container. 
- `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows`Defines the columns and rows of the grid with a space-separated list of values. 
- If multiple lines share the same name, they can be referenced by their line name and count. `grid-column-start: col-start 2;`
- A period `.`signifies an empty cell. 
- `grid-template` = a shorthand for setting grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns, and grid-template-areas in a single declaration.
