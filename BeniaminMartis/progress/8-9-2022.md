- `git status`:  It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.


- `git commit`To add and commit files to a Git repository
Enter git status to see the changes to be committed. Enter git commit -m '<commit_message>' at the command line to commit new files/changes to the local repository. For the <commit_message>, you can enter anything that describes the changes you are committing.

- `git push`: Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to git fetch , but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches.

- `git clone`: The git clone command copies an existing Git repository.

- `git pull`: used to download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content

- `git add`: adds a change in the working directory to the staging area

- `git fetch`: grabs the latest changes that are on the branch you type. You write Git fitch than (type the remote word right after) git fetch is a primary command used to download contents from a remote repository. git fetch is used in conjunction with git remote , git branch , git checkout , and git reset to update a local repository to the state of a remote.

- `git checkout`: lets you navigate between the branches created by git branch . Checking out a branch updates the files in the working directory to match the version stored in that branch, and it tells Git to record all new commits on that branch.

- `git branch`:  lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches. It doesn't let you switch between branches or put a forked history back together again. For this reason, git branch is tightly integrated with the git checkout and git merge commands.

- `cd`: change directory; allows you to move between directories. The cd command takes an argument, usually the name of the folder you want to move to, so the full command is cd your-directory .

- `ls`:  used to list files. "ls" on its own lists all files in the current directory except for hidden files. "ls *.

- `code`: type (code .)  to open the visual studio code. if you dont write the . it will not open in the same location, it will open in a random location.

- `git checkout -b` :if you want to check out git branch and git checkout you write git checkout -b
