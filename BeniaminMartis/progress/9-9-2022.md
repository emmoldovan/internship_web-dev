- Today I lerned that: the `em` unit sets the font size relative to the font size of the parent element. So, giving text a font-size of 2em will make this text twice the size of its surrounding text. 
- Setting font size in em units is ideal for an inclusive design. Since ems are a relative unit, users can adjust the text size in all browsers. 

- `Position relative` is the parent of `position absolute`. 
- `text-decoration-line: underline;`
- Also I wread many articless regarding CSS, viewed many youtube videos regarding CSS and HTML, and wrote an article about the BOX model on Linkedin.
