- `Inserting HTML Comments`
<!-- --> (this is how you leave an html comment the note goes between the lines, the comment will not show on the site it will only show in the notepad, so it is easier to organize your html site. Always leave comments as reference for yourself  )

- I have learned how to add `CSS style` in the head section of the document. I learned that when I add CSS in the head of the document that CSS automatically shows up to the entire section that I specify in the head.

```html
<head>
    <style>
        h1 {
                font-size: 60px;
            }
        p{
                font-size: 24px; 
                color:steelblue
            }
        a{
                color:hotpink
            }
        img {
                font-size: medium;
                border-width: 30px;
            }
        ol {
                text-align: center;
            }
    </style>
</head>
```
