Today I have concentrated most of my attention on practicing more CSS comands. 
I also learned how to control the 

- I have learned that, `Margins` are used to control the position of an element relative to those around it.
<ul>

- margin-left
- margin-right
- margin-top
- margin-bottom

</ul>
- There is also a shorthand margin property, and its easy to remember it because it's clockwise. 
<ul>

`margin: 10px 20px 30px 40px` 
- First value the _(10px)_ is always the _top_.
- Second value _(20px)_ is always _right_
- Third value _(30px)_ is always _bottom_
- Fourth value _(40px)_ is always _left_
</ul>

- If you only write `margin: 10px` (that will put 10px to top, right, bottom, and left
- If you write `margin:10px 20px` (that will make the _10px TOP and BOTTOM_) (and the _20px LEFT and RIGHT_)
<br>

- If you have `margin: 20px 10px 15px 10px` (you could write `margin: 20px 10px 15px`) You can do this since the right is the same as the left. In that case If you only write the right the browser automatically will identify that the left is also the same by default. 

- Padding is used to control the positioning of content inside our element. (it works just like margin in terms of the long form and shorthand properties)
- `Margin` is like adding empty space but without background, and `Padding` is like adding empty space but with background.
