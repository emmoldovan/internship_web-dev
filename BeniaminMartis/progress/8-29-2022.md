- Today I have learned how to style CSS more, I have practiced a lot. Mainly how to structure the body, header, main, and footer. How to insert CSS Background color, align text, borders, margin, padding, etc..

Im still tryiing to figure out how to make the columns look neat, Im on the right track because I understand how it happens and what I'm supposed to do, just need more practice. I have to go back and verify miself often. But I like.
