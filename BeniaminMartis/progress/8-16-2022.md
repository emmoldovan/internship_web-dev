I have learned that < p > is a paragraph tag
Tags are inside the of <>

CLosing tags include a forward slash </>

Everything from the opening and closing tag is called an element.

The very first thing at the top of every document, tells the browser that this is an HTML 5 document. <!DOCTYPE>

`index.html must be in the root folder`

HTML - Anchors and attributes 

`Attributes` are always within the opening tag. 
- `attributes` are normally followed by an equal sign and quotation marks

<a href="https://google.com">google</a>

`some elements require an attribute` a link will not work without an `href` attribute.


- `Absolute paths` if the page you are linking to is NOT part of your website, `it MUST start with http:// or https://` to let the browser know it is an external site that you are linking too. if you dont add that in there and you just pus www.something.com its not going to work. you really need to have that in the beginning. 
- `Relative Paths` you can link to other pages within your site by simply putting their file name. 
- visit our <a href="about-us.html">about us</a> page!
- or if something is in a sub folder you put the folder name forword slash and than the file name. 
- visit our <a href="team/john.html">about us</a> page!
