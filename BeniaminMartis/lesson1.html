            <p><Strong>git status</Strong>:  It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.</p>
            <p><strong>git commit</strong>To add and commit files to a Git repository</p>
            <p><Strong>Git status</Strong> to see the changes to be committed. Enter git commit -m '<commit_message>' at the command line to commit new files/changes to the local repository. For the <commit_message>, you can enter anything that describes the changes you are committing.</p>
            <p><strong>git push</strong> Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to git fetch , but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches.</p>
            <p><strong>git clone</strong> The git clone command copies an existing Git repository.</p>
            <p><strong>git pull</strong>  used to download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content</p>
            <p><strong>git add</strong>adds a change in the working directory to the staging area</p>
            <p><strong>git fetch</strong> grabs the latest changes that are on the branch you type. You write Git fitch than (type the remote word right after) git fetch is a primary command used to download contents from a remote repository. git fetch is used in conjunction with git remote , git branch , git checkout , and git reset to update a local repository to the state of a remote.</p>
            <p><strong>git checkout</strong> lets you navigate between the branches created by git branch . Checking out a branch updates the files in the working directory to match the version stored in that branch, and it tells Git to record all new commits on that branch.</p>
            <p><strong>git branch</strong>  lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches. It doesn't let you switch between branches or put a forked history back together again. For this reason, git branch is tightly integrated with the git checkout and git merge commands.</p>
            <p><strong>cd</strong> change directory; allows you to move between directories. The cd command takes an argument, usually the name of the folder you want to move to, so the full command is cd your-directory .</p>
            <p><strong>ls</strong>  used to list files. "ls" on its own lists all files in the current directory except for hidden files. "ls *.</p>
            <p><strong>code type (code .)</strong>  to open the visual studio code. if you dont write the . it will not open in the same location, it will open in a random location.</p>
            <p style="text-align:center"><strong>git checkout -b</strong> if you want to check out git branch and git checkout you write git checkout -b (creaza branch dar te si muta pe acel branch care il creezi)</p>

                <!-- if you only write margin: 10px (that will put 10px to top, right, bottom, and left -->
                <!-- There is also a shorthand margin property, it's clockwise. 10px always on top, 20px always right, 30px always bottom, 40px always left-->
                <!-- Padding is more background, and Margin is more empty space -->
                <p style="margin: 10px 20px 30px 40px; padding: 20px;"> The box model: most elements are block level elements by default.<br>
                    They have a width of 100% of their parent, a height of 0. the height grows to match the content.
