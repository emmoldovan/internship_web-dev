- ## Today I continued working on creating the 4th html practice page and finished of writing the html code of the page, in my GitHub repository ([link](https://github.com/CristianMicicoi/practice-page-4)), I'm going to continue styling the CSS part of the rest of page. 
- ## I also continued following the long version course from intership on youtube, still learning some new things about html form and input and want to learn other new things by following the whole course.

- No questions for today progress.
