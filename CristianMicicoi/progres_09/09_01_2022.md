- ## Today I started creating the footer of the first page of the html practice, I structured all the elements in it but I didn't finish it, it doesn't look nice at all, I have to add style and work with flexbox in CSS and then add hover to all the attributes with links and to the button from the page. I hope to complete these proposed tasks by tomorrow eod.
- ## At the moment I have no questions from what I have done so far, I just have to learn. :D
