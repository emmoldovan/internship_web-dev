- ## I have **finished** (with a lot of help from my colleagues, whom I thank) creating the first page (Spotify- copy to perfect) from practicing HTML, and I also learned even more by practicing about flexbox, hover and selectors. Today I finished the footer part of the page, then created the hover for buttons, anchor tags and images on the page. I know I'm further behind than the programming was and I want to continue learning next week with the next longer course and finish creating the other pages from the practice.
