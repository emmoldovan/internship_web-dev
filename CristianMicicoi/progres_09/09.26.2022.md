- ## I have started today the Creative JavaScript Course, reaching the episode 14 from chapter one of the course while practicing, in my GitHub repository ([link](https://github.com/CristianMicicoi/JS.git)) and I have learned about: 
    - variables
    - operators
    -  dataTypes
    -  concatination
    -  conditions
    -  functions
    -  objects
    -  arrays
    -  switch

Still have a lot to learn, no questions for today.
