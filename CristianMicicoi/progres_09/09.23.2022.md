- ## Yesterday and today I continued learning about HTML forms validation, working on the 4th practice page and today I finally finished building the page, with the help of colleagues. I still have small parts to finish, such as the hover on the checkboxes and I will finish those too ([link](https://github.com/CristianMicicoi/practice-page-4.git) here). I also posted the article on LinkedIn about HTML forms.
- I have no questions for today.
