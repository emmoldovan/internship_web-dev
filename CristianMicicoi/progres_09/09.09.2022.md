- ## For today I continued with the construction of the third html page(in GitHub repository: _practice-page_3_), I've learned again a basic rule that I foggoted: into a _button_ tag, you never put an _anchor_ tag, because the focus from the button will be on the thext inside the button, not just on the button! I also posted a fourth article on LinkedIn(not much content). I also have to keep learning and the long tutorial on youtube, where I have something to learn, I'm sure.
- And for the moment I don't have any questions.
