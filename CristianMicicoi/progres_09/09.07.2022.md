- ## Today I finished creating the second page of the practical exercises for html (again help from the oclegs, who guided me), in my GitHub repostory: _html-exercises_. 
- I don't have any questions at the moment, I have to start with the third page of the practical exercises and in parallel continue to learn from the long tutorial of the internship tasks.
