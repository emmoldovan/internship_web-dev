- ## Today I worked on the "search form input" section for arranging and positioning elements, in my "html-exerises" repository in GitHub and learned more on how to position and vertically center an element with absolute position, applying attributes to it:
```` css
 position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 12px;
    transform: translateY(-50%);
    line-height: 0;
````
