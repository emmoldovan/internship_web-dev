## 1. My progress today:
 - I have completed the review and modification of some elements, finally finished the third page and started building the fourth page of Intership - html practice exercises in my GitHub repository: practice-page-4 - [link](https://github.com/CristianMicicoi/practice-page-4.git) ;
 <br>

 - I have documented and learned more from the tutorials and lessons in the intership documentation, finding out more detailes I didn't know about: CSS selectors & combinators, CSS specificity, pseudo elements and classes, pseudo elements ::before and ::after, simplifying CSS with pseudo-class :is().

<br>

- ### No questions for today's progress.
