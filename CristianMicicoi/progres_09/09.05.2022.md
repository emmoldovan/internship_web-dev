- ## Today I started creating the second html page from intership exercises, I researched, I was helped by colleagues to better understand and build the cards, I learned how to create cards grid, setting and transform images in cards, and new commands:
````
grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
`````
  ##### * where "3" is the number is the number that tells the control how many rows of columns to be, and "1fr(fraction)" shows that all columns must be the same.
