- ## Today I've continued learning and practicing more exercises about arrays, with functions, in JavaScript in my GitHub repository ([link](https://github.com/CristianMicicoi/JS.git) here). I have also posted the weekly article on LinkedIn about my progress from the begining of the Internship. Further on, I want to continue the course and learn more, right now being at the second chapter of the course where I started learning about DOM.
    - I don't have questions for today.
