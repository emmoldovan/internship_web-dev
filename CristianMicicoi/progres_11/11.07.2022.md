- ## In the last days I have continued mostly practicing JavaScript, on friday I've posted another article on LinkedIn, and currently I'm working on "Job app" exercise, you can see my work in my "JS" GitHub repository([link](https://github.com/CristianMicicoi/JS.git) here).
  - At the moment I have a problem with the splice() method, which I need to study further, which deletes the first card and not the selected card from the card list.
