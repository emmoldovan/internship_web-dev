- ## In last two days I've continued learning and practicing JavaScript, now I'm practicing more in crearting the "splitter app(mini)", taking example from challenges in Frontend Mentor site. You can see my work in my GitHub repository ([link](https://github.com/CristianMicicoi/JS.git) here).
- I don't have questions for today.
