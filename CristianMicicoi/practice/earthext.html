    <h2 class="earth-title">Orbit and rotation</h2>
    <h3>Rotation</h3>
    <p>Earth's rotation period relative to the Sun—its mean solar day—is 86,400 seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025
        SI seconds). Because Earth's solar day is now <em>slightly</em> longer than it was during the 19th century due
        to tidal deceleration, <strong>each day varies between 0 and 2 SI ms longer</strong>.</p>
    <h3>Orbit</h3>
    <p>Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 150 million km (93 million mi) every 365.2564 mean solar
        days, or one sidereal year. This gives an apparent movement of the Sun eastward with respect to the stars at a
        rate of about 1°/day, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12 hours. Due to this motion, on average
        it takes 24 hours—a solar day—for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to
        the meridian. The orbital speed of Earth averages about 29.78 km/s (107,200 km/h; 66,600 mph), which is fast
        enough to travel a distance equal to Earth's diameter, about 12,742 km (7,918 mi), in seven minutes, and the
        distance to the Moon, 384,000 km (239,000 mi), in about 3.5 hours.</p>
    <p>The Moon and Earth orbit a common barycenter every 27.32 days relative to the background stars. When combined
        with the Earth–Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, the period of the synodic month, from new moon to new
        moon, is 29.53 days. Viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial
        rotations are all counterclockwise. Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth,
        Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely
        aligned: Earth's axis is tilted some 23.44 degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth–Sun plane (the ecliptic),
        and the Earth–Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1 degrees against the Earth–Sun plane. Without this tilt, there
        would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses.</p>
