    <h1 style="text-align: center; color:blue ;">A future programmer!</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; background-color:beige ; color: darkblue; text-align: center;" ;>My name is
        <strong>Cristian
            Micicoi</strong>, I'm 30
        years
        old and I've start to learn web design first with <em>DIVI</em> builder on <strong>Wordpress</strong> and now I
        continue with learning programming, first with <em>HTML and CSS</em>, after that I will learn
        <em>JavaScript</em>. I really like this software developer job, I'm at the beginning, I'm a junior, it is a
        whole new domain for me, but I'm looking forward to become a good programmer and learn as many programming
        languages as possible.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: #f88900;">About me</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 21px; color:brown">I am at the beginning of my career as a programmer, I like everything
        related to computers
        and especially the
        part of software developer that I started.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 21px; color:brown">I am an optimistic and realistic person, with a high but calculated sense of
        humor, I am
        fulfilled in life, with
        my beautiful and understanding wife, Romina!</p>
    <h2 style="background-color: bisque; color: green;">What made me start learning programming?</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: center; color: darkblue">Since I was a child I was passionate about
        <strong>everything</strong> everything
        related to computers, in the
        beginning I was amazed by numerous programs to <em>write</em> CDs and how you can put games on CD or DVD to have
        copies and install them when needed especially, at that time (14 years ago), then things have advanced,
        programs have also changed, games have changed too, have become even more spectacular, and I always had the
        <em>passion</em> to
        work with some programs and for entertainment in connection with computers.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center; color: darkblue">I still remember like it was yesterday how we used
        to
        gather several friends at the
        house of one of us, one by
        one and play the games of that time and here I can say that the two most played games then were <strong>GTA San
            Andreas</strong> and
        <strong>Counter- Strike 1.6</strong>. But with the passage of time and childhood, I left aside for a while
        everything related to
        computers. But today, thanks to an <em>invitation</em> from a real friend, to whom I will be grateful all my
        life, I got back to what I liked to do as a child, but now much more advanced, on this part of web design and
        programming.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; color:coral; text-align: center;">I am confident that I can make a career out of this
        field, even
        though I am just
        starting out, there is so much
        to learn and it all seems so overwhelming, but the things that are learned the hard way stay for longer, even
        for life!</p>
