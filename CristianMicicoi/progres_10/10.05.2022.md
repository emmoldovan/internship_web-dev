- ## I have finished to watch the Ro language tutorial on Youtube and the practice of the mini-project exercise on my GitHub repository ([link](https://github.com/CristianMicicoi/JS.git) here!).
- ### Further on, I want to continue the JS course, with learning and practice in parallel.
- I have no questions for today!
