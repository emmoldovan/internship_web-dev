- ## In the last two days I have continued learning and practice JS course after "The Creative Course" and creating a calculator app with enabled "+", "-", "=" and "reset" functions. You can see it in my GitHub repository "JS"([link](https://github.com/CristianMicicoi/JS.git) here); 
-  For today I don't have question.
