- ## In last week I continued learning about JavaScript and also practice by creating some mini-apps or exercises, and now I'm working on another exercise(Splitter). You can find all work I've done in my GitHub repository ([link](https://github.com/CristianMicicoi/JS.git) here).
   - I don't have any questions for today.
