> ## Today I have learning about box model

- Most elements are "block level" elements by default
  - they have a width of 100% of their parent
  - they have a height of 0
  - the height grows to match the content
  - they stack one on top of the other
  - !!! _Try to avoid setting height_ !!! to avoid text problems (written one over the other)
- Margins and padding (+shorthand)
- Borders (+ shorthand)
- Box wrap up and the four parts of an element

And I practiced in _practice_ folder with everything I learned today!
