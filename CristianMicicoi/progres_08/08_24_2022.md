> ## So, today I have learning about :

- external CSS : the syntax and stylesheet and how to implement it with a link wich links to my CSS file.
- the relationship between HTML and CSS and the primary three ways to select something from page :
  - _element_ selector
  - _class_ selector (in CSS is represented by '.')
  - _id_ selector (in CSS is represented by '#')
- ID vs Class : I can't have the same ID twice in one page; a class can be used over and over again and _only once if you want_; ID will owerwrite a class if they are both selecting the same thing.
- naming classes and IDs
- comments
- tags and layouts that I need to know for now

And a lot of practice on different pages in "practice" folder about how to implement and know better what I've learning!
