> ## **GIT commands**

- ### **_git innit_** (Create a hidden .git directory for your project) ;

- ### **_git status_** (Displays the state of the working directory and the staged snapshot.) ;
- ### **_git add <file.js file1.js file2.js>_** (Adds specified/ multiple files.It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit.) ;
- ### **_git add . _** (add all the files inside the project folder in the staging area) ;
- ### **_git commit -m_** (Creates a commit message, to know easier what was changed, which is like a snapshot of your repository.) ;
- ### **_git commit --amend_** (This command takes your staging area and uses it for the commit. If you’ve made no changes since your last commit, for instance, you run this command immediately after your previous commit, then your snapshot will look exactly the same, and all you’ll change is your commit message.)
- ### **_git log_** (Show the history of commits) ;
- ### **_git checkout <commit-hash/id>_** (Replace `<commit-hash>` with the actual hash for the specific commit that you want to visit, which is listed with the `git log` command.) ;
- ### **_git checkout master_** (This command is used to go back to the master branch) ;
- ### **_git push_** (Uploads all local branch commits to the corresponding remote branch. Updates the remote branch with local commits. It is one of the four commands in Git that prompts interaction with the remote repository.) ;
- ### **_git pull_** (Update your local working branch with commits from the remote, and update all remote tracking branches.Without running git pull, your local repository will never be updated with changes from the remote.) ;
- ### **_git fetch_** (Updates the remote tracking branches.) ;
- ### **_git branch <new-branch-name>_** (Lets you create new isolated development environments/branches within a single repository.) ;
- ### **_git checkout <branch-name>_** (Switch to a different branch/switch to a different isolated timeline of the project by changing branches.) ;
- ### **_git branch-d <branch-name>_** (With this command you can delete a branch.) ;
- ### **_git ckeckout -b <new-branch-name>_** (Create a new branch and change to it at the same time.) ;
- ### **_git clone + repository url_** (Clone remote repository to local machine) ;
- ### **_git push --set-upstream origin_** (Create remote branch and push changes) ;
