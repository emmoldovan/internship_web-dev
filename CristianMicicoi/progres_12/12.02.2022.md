- ## Last week I've continued learning about JavaScript Objects from "The Creative JavaScript Course", chapter 5 completed, and also learning and exercise from freeCodeCamp ([link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/comparison-with-the-equality-operator) here). Today I also posted the article on LinkedIn.
    - I don't have any questions for today, I still have a lot to learn!
