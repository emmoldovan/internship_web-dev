- ## In the last week I've continued learning about JavaScript, started learning React and starting the course: "The Creative React and Redux Course" by DevelopedByEd, another interesting course, seems hard at first, but with learning I know it will become easy. You can see my work in my GitHub repository: React-learning-and-practicing([link](https://github.com/CristianMicicoi/React-learning-and-practicing.git) here).
  - I have no question for today.
