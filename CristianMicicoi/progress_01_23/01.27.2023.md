- ## In the last week I've continued learning React and continue with the course: "The Creative React and Redux Course" by DevelopedByE, and alternately with working on the Nutriscore application, together with my colleague Dani. You can see our work in Dani's GitHub repository: nutriscore-app([link](https://github.com/DaniPantea99/nutriscore-app.git) here).
  - I have no question for today.
