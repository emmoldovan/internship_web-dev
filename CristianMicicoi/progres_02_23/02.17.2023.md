- ## In the last week I've continued learning React, working on create Flashcard app in React, in my GitHub repository React-learning-and-practicing/flashcards-app ([link](https://github.com/CristianMicicoi/React-learning-and-practicing.git)here), and alternately working on the Nutriscore application, helping my colleague Dani, I have implemented the i18next for translate the pages in app. You can see our work in Dani's GitHub repository: nutriscore-app ([link](https://github.com/DaniPantea99/nutriscore-app.git) here).
  - I have no question for today.
