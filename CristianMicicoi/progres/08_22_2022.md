# Today I've continued learning:

- HTML Lists
  - ordered list
  - unordered list
- HTML Images
  - the image syntax:
  ```
  <img src="image.jpg or folder/image.jpg or folder../image.jpg" width="" height="" alt="" >
  ```

And making practice in **_practice_** folder about how to implement the lists and the images in html.
