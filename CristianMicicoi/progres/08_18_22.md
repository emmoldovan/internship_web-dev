- ## Today I have learned a bit of CSS(_it's all about style_); more exactly the _syntax_ (there must be a colon ':' between the _property_ and _value_; the _value_ is always followed by a semicolon ';') and _style attribute_;
- ## CSS is all about _property: value_ pairs: _properties_ are what we want to change(color,font-size,font-weight); _values_ are what we want to set that property to(which color, font-size dimension).
- ## I've also practice and creating 2 little html pages(in the "practice" folder) about anchors and atributes, applying links that take me from one page to another; I started the practical learning for CSS, adding another html page where I practiced according to the lessons in the course on how to change the background color, as well as the text color or text background.
