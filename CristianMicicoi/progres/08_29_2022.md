## **My progress for today**:

- I have partially started creating the page "Spotify"(copy-to-perfect) on my repository but I got stuck in the "main" section where I have to put 3 images(laptop, circle, check mark) on top of each other;
- I also learned a bit more about flexbox, display:flex, the flex-wrap, justify-content and add a gap between elements;

## _Regarding the technical article I'm going to post on LinkedIn_:

- I thought at first to explain the steps related to the creation of the "_commit message_" with what I did in the workspace (in my case, with the help of the wonderful and helpful Visual Studio Code), then push it on the on the branch set by the owner or supervisor, called "main" by default on GitHub, and the steps to create a PR (pull request), which is about approving the progress(or practice, or tasks you have to do), and then merging it into the main branch with the other PRs from your team or coleagues approved by the supervisor. It amazed me from the start how this platform works. But nothing's settled, I'll probably come back with more material for the article. :)
