- ## Today I continued creating the "Spotify" page in my GitHub repository called _**html-exercises**_, I learned better and got more used to _Flexbox_ and how to use it to help me in arranging sections, creating columns and placing elements in the page. I also practiced more adding style with CSS, getting more familiar with the classes I assign in HTML, and then applying style to them in CSS.
- I'm still having a bit of a hard time creating the page but I'm convinced that more practice will help me, learning and getting used to writing properties in HTML and CSS, as well as better visualizing the division of a page into sections.
