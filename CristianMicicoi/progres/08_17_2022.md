> ## HTML - strong and emphasis

```
<strong> (the text inside <strong>) indicates that it is of strong importance; browsers make this text bold);
```

```
<em> (the text inside <em></em> has stress emphasis, browsers make this text italic);
```

- ## They are inline elements

  - use <"strong"> and <"em">(I write like this with quotation marks, because otherwise it appears as a line of code) ;
  - you must close a <"strong"> or <"em"> before the end of your paragraph

> ## File naming and organization

- ## File naming: keep file names short; they should be descriptive(e.g. "page2.html" vs. "about us .html"); no spaces, use underscores or hyphens instead; use lower case("About-us.html" vs "about-us.html");
- ## File organization: the main folder is called our **root folder**; the homepage **must be _index.html_** ; **_index.html_** must be in the root folder , and not a sub-folder; other pages can be in subfolder, depending on how you want to stay organized; images should be placed in a sub folder for better organization.

> ## HTML - anchors and attributes

```
  <a> (short for "anchor") used to link either to a different location within the current page or to another page; we tell the anchor to link to with ATRIBUTES;
```

- atributes are normally followed by an equal sign and quotation marks; a link will not work without an **_href_** attribute:

- If the page you are linking to is not part of your website, it must start with _http://_ or _https://_ to let the browser now it is an external site that you are linking to.
