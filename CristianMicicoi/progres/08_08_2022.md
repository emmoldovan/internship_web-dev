> GIT commands

- ### **git status** (displays the state of the working directory and the staged snapshot.) ;
- ### **git add** (adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit.) ;
- ### **git commit** (creates a commit, which is like a snapshot of your repository. These commits are snapshots of your entire repository at specific times.) ;
- ### **git push** (uploads all local branch commits to the corresponding remote branch. Updates the remote branch with local commits. It is one of the four commands in Git that prompts interaction with the remote repository.) ;
- ### **git pull** (Update your local working branch with commits from the remote, and update all remote tracking branches.Without running git pull, your local repository will never be updated with changes from the remote.) ;
- ### **git fetch** (Updates the remote tracking branches.) ;
- ### **git branch** (Lets you create isolated development environments within a single repository.) ;
- ### **git checkout** (Updates files in the working tree to match the version in the index or the specified tree. If no pathspec was given, git checkout will also update HEAD to set the specified branch as the current branch.) ;
- ### **git clone** + repository url (clone remote repository to local machine) ;
- ### **git push --set-upstream origin** (create remote branch and push changes) ;
