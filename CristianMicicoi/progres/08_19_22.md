# Today I continue with learning CSS _basic styles_ and _colors_ to implement them in the page using HTML.

- ## Some basic styles:

  - _font-size_ - sets the font size, for now we stick to pixels (px) ;
  - _color_ - change the color of the text ;
  - _background-color_ - sets the background color ;
  - _tex-align_ - align the next to the **left, center or right** ;

- ## **Colors** can be set with keywords, hex codes, rhg and hsl values:
  - _keywords_ - "red", "steelblue", "hotpink" etc.
  - _hex_ - hexadecimal values: **#7ab0fb** etc.
  - _rgb_ - Red, Green, Blue: \*\*rgb(0,255,0) etc.
  - _hsl_ - Hue, Saturation, Lightness: hsl(240, 100%, 75%) etc.

## And with all that I have learned untill now, I create a new page in _practice_ folder(aboutme.html) to work and learn better by practicing exercises and recap everything I have learned.

- ## Posting my first article on LinkedIn with what I have learned and how I have learned so far.
